# Titanic Data Visualization 📊

This Jupyter Notebook focuses on visualizing insights from the Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib. It helps uncover patterns in survival rates, passenger demographics, and other key attributes.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is `Titanic-Dataset.csv` containing details such as:
- Passenger class
- Sex
- Age
- Survival status
- Fare
- Embarkation port

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `pandas` — for data loading and manipulation  
- `matplotlib.pyplot` — for creating basic plots  
- `seaborn` — for advanced visualizations with cleaner aesthetics  

## 🎯 Visualizations Included

The notebook may include the following (based on structure and standard practice):

- Countplot of passengers by survival
- Histogram or KDE of age distribution
- Box plots by class and gender
- Scatter plots (e.g., Age vs. Fare)
- Heatmaps for correlation

## ✅ How to Run

1. Make sure `Titanic-Dataset.csv` is in the same folder.
2. Install required packages (if not already):

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
